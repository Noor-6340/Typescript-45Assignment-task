// 42:Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified .

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {

    for (const magician of magicians) {
        console.log((magician.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + magician.slice(1)));
    }
}
function make_great(magician: string[]): void{
for(let i = 0; i < magician.length; i++){ //i stand for index of string
magician[i] = magician[i] +  ' the great'
}
} 
const magician2: string[] = ["ali","sonia","roha"];
make_great(magician2)
show_magicians(magician2)
