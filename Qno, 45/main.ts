// 45: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

type car = {
    manufacture:string
    model: string
    [key: string]: any;
}
function createCar(manufacture:string, model:string, optional: Record<string,any>):car {
    return {
        manufacture,
        model,
       ...optional
    }
}
const mycar: car = createCar("toyato","corolla",{color: "silver", year:"2023"})

console.log(mycar)
