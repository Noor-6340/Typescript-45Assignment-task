// 12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
// Make array
let names = ["shumaila", "ayesha", "shagufta"];
// Send message
let message = "would you like to learn typescript with me";
console.log(names[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names[2] + " " + message);
